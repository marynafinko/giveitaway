# Give It Away

Project was created to establish an environment, where users can post items, that they are willing to give away for free.
Every item that you are about to throw away, can still serve to someone else and receive a new life. 
Give It Away was created to support sustainability of things and fight with consumerism. 

### Tech Stack

Website was created using Django 4.1.3 Web Framework with server-side templating. 
Pillow 9.3.0 ensures that the images can be uploaded by users and retrieved from the database afterwards.
Give It Away is operating on SQL Lite 3 database.

### Features
